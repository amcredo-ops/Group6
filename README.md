1. What is the difference between commit and push?
Commit is the saved files in the local repo, it is the snapchat of the project in the repository while push is the information or data inputted in the repository, it is being shared with developers.
2. Why branches is important?
Branches are important because it assigned every developer to access dedicated branch for modidying, deleting and debugging line of code without affecting other branches.
3. What causes merge conflicts?
The merge conflict happens when git tries to combine changes from different branches but it cannot decide automatically which version is correct. When two or more changes happens in a way that looks ambigous, git stops and asks the developer to step in. One example is editing and deleting files, for gits point of view it is confusing.
